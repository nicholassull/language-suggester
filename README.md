# _Programming Language Suggester_

#### By _**Nick Sullivan**_

#### _A short quiz to find out which programming language suits you best._

## Technologies Used

* _HTML_
* _CSS_
* _JavaScript_
* _Bootstrap_

## Description

_This is a 5-question quiz that uses radial inputs to receive a user's answer. Using simple branching logic, the webpage will reveal which programming language (out of JavaScript, Python, and C#) that the user should learn. Once the form is submitted, the viewport will move to the bottom of the page and an area holding the result will fade in. This project is meant to demonstrate my understanding of branching and the use of 'if', 'else if', and 'else' statements._
